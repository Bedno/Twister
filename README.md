Automatic Talking Twister Spinner WepApp

Newest version in a long line of implementations I've done of this concept.
This one is optimized for simplicity, requiring only an index file and a few images.
Uses the text to speech capability built-in to modern browsers.

Past versions included a Visual Basic Windows app some twenty years ago, and 10 years ago a browser version using wav files of actual voices.
I also recently built a tiny dedicated hardware version using a microcontroller.
